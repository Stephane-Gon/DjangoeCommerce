This was my first Ecommerce django project.

I used Django to handle all the backend with some dependencies and vanilla javascript for the frontend.
For production I deployed the website in heroku so I had to use an external storage for my media files and I decided to use Amazon Web Services S3 buckets.

For the styling I used scss for my first time.
