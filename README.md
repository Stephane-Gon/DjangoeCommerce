# DjangoeCommerce
My first functional eCommerce project

 So this is my first functional eCommerce project, where I used new technologies I have never used before and made entirely by me including the design.
  This project was made for a small and young company that sells products typical from north Portugal, I decided to take this job as a way of 
 getting experience for the next projects I will do and to understand a little bit more of the production side of making an website.
 
 
 1º In this project I used Django for the backend;
    - For the backend I had to install a few dependencies to deal with forms;
    
 2º Vanilla JavaScript for the frontend;
    - I went with vanilla Javascript so I could gain a little bit of more experience with it,
    before I start using React;
 
 3º SASS for the styling;
    - I used sass because I like the way it can be organized, making it easier to search for
    what I'm loking for;
    
 4º Paypal API to receive payments;
    - For the first time I used paypal API that allows me to receive payments via paypal or credit card; 
    
 5º AWS S3 buckets to store static and media files once the app was deployed;
    - Since heroku does not host media files I decided to store both static and media files
    on a bucket from AWS S3. This was also the first time I used this method and I found it quite useful;
   
 6º I used Weglot to translate;
   - I decided to use weglot to translate the website, since I wanted to know How would that work;
 
 7º Heroku to host the app;
   - Since this is not a really big project or company, I decided to go with a simple way of hosting so that
   the admin can easily monitor it;
   
 

I'm still making changes and trying to improve this website as much as I can.
